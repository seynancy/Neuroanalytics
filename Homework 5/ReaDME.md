- This folder contains assignments from Homework 5. In the phenotypic data (qt.phe), we can conclude that a vast majority of the phenotype values fall within 6 and 7.5
- In genohisto.R, the distribution of minor allele frequencies follows the shape of a bell curve. The most frequent frequency is around 0.03
- In the Alcohol Manhattan plot, we observe ~3 positions on chromosome 4 where SNPs the genome wide signiciance threshold.
