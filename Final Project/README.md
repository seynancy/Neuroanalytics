The goal of this set of codes is to generate a clean singlecell RNA sequencing dataset to be used to identify cellular 
expression profiles of various substance use phenotypes upon drug treatment. To accomplish,we will use a publicly available
dataset from Bhattacherjee et al.2019. 
Input Data
  - Two input datasets are needed to run the code; A metadata and an expression dataset.
  - Metadata is included in this repository as GSE124952_meta_data.csv.gz
  - Expression data can be obtained from https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE124952 as GSE124952_expression_matrix.csv.gz. I am unable to upload expression data to the repository due to its large size
